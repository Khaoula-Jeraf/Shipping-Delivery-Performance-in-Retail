# BI Project | Shipping & Delivery Performance in Retail

## Project Overview 

This project is a **Business Intelligence (BI) initiative** focused on **shipping and delivery performance in the retail sector**.

In a context where customers are increasingly impatient and delivery expectations are rising, logistics is no longer just an operational function. It has become a **key driver of customer satisfaction, costs, and overall business performance**.

The objective of this project is to **analyze shipment performance**, identify **logistics risks**, and provide **data-driven insights** to support operational and strategic decision-making.

## Business Context & Problem Statement

Retailers manage:
- multiple shipping modes  
- growing shipment volumes  
- geographically dispersed customers  

Yet, several critical questions remain unanswered:
- Which shipping modes are truly performant?
- Are faster deliveries always more profitable?
- Where are logistics risks concentrated?
- Is delivery performance improving over time?

This dashboard addresses these challenges by transforming raw data into **actionable insights**.

## Key Business Questions Answered

1. **Is shipment growth aligned with sales growth?**  
   → Ensuring logistics capacity scales efficiently with business activity.

2. **Which shipping modes provide the best balance between delivery speed and profitability?**  
   → Identifying trade-offs between service level and cost.

3. **Where are the main logistics risk zones geographically?**  
   → Detecting states with longer delivery times and higher delivery pressure.

4. **Is delivery performance improving year over year?**  
   → Measuring the impact of logistics initiatives over time.
